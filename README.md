<img src="./assets/graph-presentation.png" width="700"/>

The project highly emphasizes algorithms with graph theory. We used the following process:
1. Integrate with school systems to get course information
2. Build a network graph that represents pre-requsite to course mapping
3. Interface with RateMyProfessor API to calculate course ratings
4. And surely a lot of algos to develop an optimal course path!
